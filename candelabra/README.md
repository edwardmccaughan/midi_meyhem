* Needs to be run in a server, eg:  `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
* if you don't have a midi piano, `qwertyuiop` works too
* best played on a projector in a dark room
* it's a work in progress. feel free to clone and hack around on your own version
* uses the webmidi.js (https://github.com/cotejp/webmidi) and ShaderParticleEngine (https://github.com/squarefeet/ShaderParticleEngine)
